![alt text](https://github.com/kitsun8/K8Gatheriino/blob/master/screenshots/gatheriino3.PNG)


A bot for Discord that helps people to form pickup games (PUGs).
Originally for Overwatch, but as the team size can be changed from settings, works with any team based game.

# What it does
0. Reads settings from appsettings.json (sample found in 'settings/appsettings.json')
1. Gathers <INSERT QUEUE SIZE> amount of people to a queue
2. Asks players to Ready up inside <INSERT TIME> seconds of time.
3. Kicks unreadied players out of the queue.
4. Decides 2 random team captains. Captainship requires <INSERT THRESHOLD> games to be played.
5. Allows captains to pick <INSERT QUEUE SIZE> amount of players to teams, either 1 by 1 or 1-2-2-2-2-1 (only tested with 12 players).
6. Announces teams when all players have been picked.

# Extra features
1. Keeps track of played games for users
2. Keeps track of first picks of users
3. Keeps track of last picks of users
4. Keeps track of captainships of users
4. Sorts users to top10 played list
5. Sorts users to top10 last picked list
6. Sorts users to top10 first picked list
